# A02 CRUD Code Snippets

 [THE PRESENTATION VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyBK-A582y0)

1. I have followed MVC (Model View Controller) pattern to structure my application. Overall, my thoughts behind the architecture is that it improves code maintenance by introducing independence and increasing dependability, resulting in more maintainable code.

2. I have used MySQL for Database course, but MangoDB is a NoSQL database, and I'm pleased I was able to learn how to use it in this course. In terms of retrieving data or JSON, I found MangoDB to be quite simple to use.

3. I am satisfied with my application and it fullfils the basic requirement.Some of the thing that I would improve is the UI and add tag functionality. 

4. My TIL for this course part is :
      * I learned how to use MongoDB and how to connect the Application.
      * My understanding of express and NODE JS in general has improved.
      * I learned how to POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE and CREATE.
      * I gained better understanding about Session and cookies.
